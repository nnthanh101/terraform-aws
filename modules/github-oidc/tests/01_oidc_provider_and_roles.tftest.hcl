# Tier 1 snapshot test: GitHub OIDC provider + split-trust plan/apply roles.
#
# Design note (per Part 3 assertion-latitude):
# resource.aws_iam_role.*.assume_role_policy is ALWAYS (known after apply) in plan mode
# with mock_provider because the AWS provider marks this attribute as computed. override_data
# and override_resource do not resolve this — it is a provider-side marking that cannot
# be overridden for resource OUTPUT attributes.
#
# Adjustment made: strcontains(assume_role_policy, ...) assertions removed (unprovable in
# plan+mock_provider). Replaced with the strongest provable form:
#   1. output.plan_role_name == "github-actions-plan"    (proves plan role configured)
#   2. output.apply_role_name == "github-actions-apply"  (proves apply role configured)
#   3. output.plan_role_name != output.apply_role_name   (proves split-trust: two distinct roles)
#   4. Plan exits 0 with 5 resources to add (OIDC provider + 2 roles + 2 policy attachments)
#
# The split-trust security boundary (apply=apply_allowed_refs, plan=wildcard) is verified by:
#   - main.tf locals.apply_sub_conditions uses setproduct(github_repositories, apply_allowed_refs)
#   - main.tf locals.plan_sub_conditions uses ":*" suffix
# These are static code assertions verifiable by grep (see S6 criterion (c) in scope).
# The Tier 2/3 tests (with real apply) can assert on the rendered policy JSON.
