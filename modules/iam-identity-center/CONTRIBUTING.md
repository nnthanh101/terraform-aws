# Contributing to iam-identity-center

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this Terraform module.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Ensure Docker is installed (container-first development)
3. Run the quick validation pipeline:

```bash
task ci:quick       # fmt + validate + lint + legal audit
task test:tier1     # Snapshot tests (2-3s, $0 cost)
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes following the existing code patterns
3. Run the full validation suite:

```bash
task validate       # terraform fmt + validate
task lint           # tflint + checkov security scan
task test           # 3-tier test suite (snapshot/localstack/integration)
task govern:legal   # Apache 2.0 compliance checks
```

4. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of changes
5. CI pipeline will run all checks automatically

## Code Standards

- **Terraform** >= 1.11.0 with AWS Provider >= 6.28, < 7.0
- **Naming**: kebab-case for modules and resources (ADR-001)
- **Testing**: Add or update `.tftest.hcl` files in `tests/` for any new functionality
- **Documentation**: README.md is auto-generated by `terraform-docs` — do not edit manually
